The process includes identifying objects, drawing precise annotations, and validating label quality before training. Data annotation is crucial because Detectron2 relies on accurately labeled data to learn object features; high-quality annotations directly improve model accuracy, reduce false detections, and ensure reliable performance in real-world applications."

Next, pretrained weights are loaded, hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of classes are set, and the model is trained using Detectron2’s training API. Finally, the trained model is evaluated on validation data and fine-tuned to improve performance."

Describe the end-to-end pipeline from data collection to deploying the model, and how you would handle challenges like occlusion or nighttime detection.**\n",
        "\n",
        "End-to-End Wildlife Monitoring Pipeline using Detectron2 (Short Paragraphs)\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline starts with data collection using camera traps, drones, and forest CCTV cameras to capture images and videos of different animal species in various conditions such as day, night, rain, and dense vegetation. This ensures the dataset represents real-world forest scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, data annotation is performed using tools like Roboflow or CVAT, where animals are labeled with bounding boxes or masks and assigned species names. The annotated dataset is exported in COCO JSON format, split into training, validation, and testing sets, and registered in Detectron2.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the model training phase, a pretrained Detectron2 model such as Faster R-CNN or Mask R-CNN is fine-tuned using transfer learning. Data augmentation (flips, scaling, brightness changes) improves robustness, and performance is evaluated using metrics like mAP and IoU.\n",
        "\n",
        "For inference and tracking, the trained model detects animals in images or video streams, and tracking algorithms like SORT or Deep SORT are used to maintain consistent IDs for animals across frames, enabling movement analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the model is deployed on edge devices or cloud servers for real-time monitoring. Challenges like occlusion are handled using instance segmentation and multi-frame tracking, while nighttime detection is improved by training on infrared/low-light data and applying brightness-based augmentations.\n"
